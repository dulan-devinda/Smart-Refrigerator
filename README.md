<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>Smart Refrigerator</strong> is designed to enhance a traditional refrigerator using sensors, actuators, and AI technology. 
  Most importantly, it prevents you from completely running out of stock of food by recognizing items that are close to finishing and alerting you in advance.
  It also provides automatic chilled water refilling, food recognition, and a door monitoring system to ensure optimal performance and user convenience.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Recognizes foods that are close to finishing using weight measurements.</li>
  <li>Automatic chilled water refilling system.</li>
  <li>Door monitoring system to ensure the door is properly closed.</li>
  <li>Uses an AI model to recognize foods inside the fridge.</li>
  <li>User Friendly dashboard</li>
</ul>
